        <p>Initially I had thought to separate this search into fiction and non-fiction, but as I pored through my favourites I realized that some of the best paragraphs in fiction summarize ideas or capture feelings or images that could have easily come from a book of philosophy, or a travelogue. Some of the best writing I’ve ever read is dialogue, however, and traditionally each piece of a dialogue is afforded its own paragraph. So I decided instead to look for the best maximum-200-word passage in any book or article I’ve read, regardless of how many paragraphs those words took up. That’s fewer words than I’ve already written in this article, so it’s pretty lean. And I decided to exclude poetry, because I thought that would be unfair to prose.</p>

        <p>“As the days went by, the evolution of like into love was accelerated. White Fang himself began to grow aware of it, though in his consciousness he knew not what love was. It manifested itself to him as a void in his being—a hungry, aching, yearning void that clamoured to be filled. It was a pain and an unrest; and it received easement only by the touch of the new god’s presence. At such times love was joy to him, a wild, keen-thrilling satisfaction. But when away from his god, the pain and the unrest returned; the void in him sprang up and pressed against him with its emptiness, and the hunger gnawed and gnawed unceasingly.”</p>
