                Feb 4 (Reuters) - SpaceX may attempt a Starship rocket system launch in March, its billionaire chief Elon Musk said in a tweet on Saturday.

                "If remaining tests go well, we will attempt a Starship launch next month," Musk said, in a response to a user's tweet about Starship.

                Musk had in January said that there was a "real shot" at launching Starship in late February, adding that a March launch attempt appears highly likely.

                SpaceX, since last year, has been looking to launch its giant Starship into orbit for the first time, a pivotal demonstration flight as it aims to fly NASA astronauts to the moon.

            If remaining tests go well, we will attempt a Starship launch next month. The ship will fly in space around Earth at an altitude of over 150 miles, then splash down off the Hawaiian coast(Opens in a new window).

            This will be a crucial demonstration of hardware NASA is depending on to get humans back on the moon in the next few years. And, if successful, it'll mean Musk is one small step closer to realizing his personal dream of building a city on Mars.

                One of the most respected cricketers in the game's history, MS Dhoni remains an active cricketer in the Indian Premier League. As some of the stars of the game -- Chris Gayle, Anil Kumble, Robin Uthappa, Scott Styris, etc. -- got together in a rapid-fire interview, they picked the 'most selfless player' in the T20 league's history. The likes of Kumble, Gayle, Uthappa and Styris all named their choice and the clear winner was none other than the legendary MS Dhoni.

                The former IPL players engaged in a variety of questions in the rapid-fire round on Jio Cinema. They were also asked about the 'most stylish player' choice where KL Rahul was the preferred option for a few.

                As for Dhoni, the IPL 2023 season could be a couple of months away but Dhoni has already begun practicing for the new season. The cricketer has been spotted undergoing a few training sessions in the nets.

                Dhoni was recently spotted meeting the members of the Indian cricket team ahead of the first T20I against New Zealand. He was seen interacting with the likes of Shubman Gill, Yuzvendra Chahal and the support staff. Even Hardik Pandya got the opportunity to speak to the veteran wicket-keeper batter.

                "Mahi bhai is here which is good as we get to meet him. We can get out of the hotel also (to meet him). Otherwise, the way we have played in the last one month, it has just been hotel to hotel," Hardik had said about the meeting with Dhoni before the match.

                Dhoni, who quit international cricket in August 2020, has continued to feature in the IPL for CSK. While Dhoni still remains a fan-favourite, the chances of him continuing to play in the T20 league beyond this season are fairly slim.
