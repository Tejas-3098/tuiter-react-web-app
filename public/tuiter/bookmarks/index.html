                Meta Inc., the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, was found by a federal jury in Austin, Texas,
                to have infringed on two patents held by Voxer Inc., a walkie talkie messaging app founded by a former
                Army Green Beret.The social media giant was ordered to pay nearly $175 million in damages.Voxer launched
                the app in 2011, which was named Best Overall App in the First Annual Silicon Valley Business App Awards
                in 2013. In 2012, Facebook approached Voxer about a potential collaboration that led to Voxer sharing
                its patents and proprietary information with the company.

                “When early meetings did not result in an agreement, Facebook identified Voxer as a competitor although
                Facebook had no live video or voice product at the time,” court filings read. “Facebook revoked Voxer’s
                access to key components of the Facebook platform and launched Facebook Live in 2015 followed by
                Instagram Live in 2016. Both products incorporate Voxer’s technologies and infringe its patents.”

                A Meta spokesperson challenged the ruling in a statement sent to technology publication TechCrunch,
                saying the social media giant will continue to press the issue through the courts.

                The National Hurricane Center expects Hurricane Ian to gain strength and become a potentially damaging
                hurricane that could make landfall in Florida in the coming days.Amazon teams across the U.S. are ready
                to
                support communities impacted by the storm, and the company is prepared to use its infrastructure,
                technology, and inventory to support those in need. “We know that when natural disasters strike,
                communities
                quickly need help—and we are mobilizing our teams and using our technology and infrastructure to be able
                to
                assist those in need as soon as possible,” said Abe Diaz, head of Amazon Disaster Relief. “Hurricane Ian
                is
                likely to be a powerful hurricane by the time it makes landfall, and we are using our logistics
                expertise
                and artificial intelligence technology to preposition the most needed products at the most effective
                locations.” We are also supporting our employees in the area, as their safety is our number one
                priority.
                Our teams near the path of the storm are implementing safety plans, and local teams will work directly
                with
                employees to offer support during this event.

                Amazon will continue to monitor this storm and rally its teams to assist communities in coordination
                with
                relief organizations and local authorities. Since its creation in 2017, Amazon Disaster Relief has
                donated
                more than 20 million items in response to 95 disasters and humanitarian crises.
